    '''
    In the east region of Ducelio lies a large stretch of skale rock. Not much [purple]poison[] has claimed this area, but there are numerous [purple]selevite[] clusters in its reach.

    [orange]Charren[] is once again sending troops to dispatch of your base. Defend against them, harvest [purple]selevite[] and [yellow]sulfur[], smelt [orange]amberglass[], and pump [orange]slag[] to use in turrets.
