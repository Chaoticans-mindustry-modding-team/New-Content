    '''
    Ruins lay here from another [purple]faction[] that attempted to conquer this sector many years ago. [orange]Charren[] had sieged their base and will siege any new bases landing on this sector. What remains is the bridge connecting the continents of Anveltria and Ducelio.
    
    Harvest [stat]Antimony[], forge [stat]Light Alloy[], research new tech, and survive [orange]Charren[]'s raid. [orange]Charren[]'s new mechs are capable of walking over walls, so you must use new turrets to slow their advance.
